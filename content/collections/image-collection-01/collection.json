  "description": "A photo collection to commemorate the British GP. With classic British weather—rainy throughout the race and clearing up just as it ended—I aimed to showcase the dynamic energy of the sport. Using long shutter speeds, I focused on panning shots to emphasize motion, the impact of the rain, and the sheer speed of the cars. To build the atmosphere and tell a fuller story, I also captured the crowd and the pit lane, adding depth beyond the track. The result is a visual memory of the race, made even more special by Lewis Hamilton's victory, marking an unforgettable moment in an ever-changing environment.",
